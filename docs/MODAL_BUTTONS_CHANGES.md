# Modal Buttons Implementation - Changes Summary

## Overview
Updated the apartment/store list view modal to implement different button sets based on property state, removing the unnecessary cancel button and adding new functionality for prereserved and sold states.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Template Model (`models/product_template.py`)

Added two new methods:

#### `action_confirm_reservation()`
- **Purpose**: Opens the related quotation for confirmation when property is in prereserved state
- **Usage**: Called when "Confirmer la reservation" button is clicked in prereserved properties
- **Returns**: Action to open the quotation form in edit mode
- **Validation**: Only works for prereserved properties

#### `action_view_reservation_document()`
- **Purpose**: Opens the reservation document (invoice or sale order) for sold properties
- **Usage**: Called when "Fiche Reservation" button is clicked in sold properties  
- **Returns**: Action to open the invoice if exists, otherwise the confirmed sale order
- **Validation**: Only works for sold properties

### 2. JavaScript Interface (`static/src/js/apartment_action.js`)

Updated the `_showPropertyOptions()` method to implement the new button logic:

#### For `disponible` properties:
- **Reserve** button (primary) - Creates new reservation
- **View Details** button (secondary) - Opens property details
- **Removed**: Cancel button (not needed)

#### For `prereserved` properties:
- **Annuler la reservation** button (warning) - Cancels the reservation
- **Confirmer la reservation** button (success) - Opens quotation for confirmation
- **View Details** button (secondary) - Opens property details

#### For `sold` properties:
- **Fiche Reservation** button (info) - Opens reservation document
- **No other buttons** (View Details removed for sold properties)

## User Experience Flow

### Disponible Properties
1. User clicks on a disponible apartment/store in list view
2. Modal shows: "Reserve" and "View Details" buttons
3. "Reserve" creates a new quotation and opens it
4. "View Details" opens the property form

### Prereserved Properties  
1. User clicks on a prereserved apartment/store in list view
2. Modal shows: "Annuler la reservation" and "Confirmer la reservation" buttons, plus "View Details"
3. "Annuler la reservation" cancels the reservation and returns property to disponible
4. "Confirmer la reservation" opens the related quotation for confirmation
5. "View Details" opens the property form

### Sold Properties
1. User clicks on a sold apartment/store in list view  
2. Modal shows only: "Fiche Reservation" button
3. "Fiche Reservation" opens the invoice (if exists) or confirmed sale order
4. This provides access to the official reservation document

## Technical Details

### Method Signatures
```python
def action_confirm_reservation(self):
    """Confirm the reservation by opening the related quotation"""
    
def action_view_reservation_document(self):
    """View the reservation document (invoice) for sold properties"""
```

### JavaScript Button Structure
```javascript
// Dynamic button creation based on apartment_state
if (propertyData.apartment_state === 'disponible') {
    // Reserve + View Details
} else if (propertyData.apartment_state === 'prereserved') {
    // Cancel + Confirm + View Details  
} else if (propertyData.apartment_state === 'sold') {
    // Fiche Reservation only
}
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Validation
- Methods validate property state before execution
- Proper error messages for invalid states
- Graceful handling of missing documents

### Frontend Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all RPC calls
- User-friendly error notifications
- Proper dialog cleanup on errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Disponible Properties**: Test reservation creation flow
2. **Prereserved Properties**: Test both cancellation and confirmation flows
3. **Sold Properties**: Test document viewing for both invoice and sale order scenarios
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with missing documents, invalid states, etc.
5. **UI/UX**: Test modal behavior, button styling, and responsiveness

## Files Modified

1. `models/product_template.py` - Added new action methods
2. `static/src/js/apartment_action.js` - Updated modal button logic
3. `views/project_views.xml` - Fixed button text (removed "total")
4. `views/building_views.xml` - Fixed button text (removed "total")

## Next Steps

1. Update the Odoo module to apply changes
2. Test the new workflow in a running Odoo instance
3. Verify proper state transitions and document access
4. Update user documentation if needed
