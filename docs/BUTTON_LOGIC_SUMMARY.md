# Modal Button Logic Summary

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The apartment list view modal buttons have been successfully implemented according to requirements:

### Button Logic by State

#### 1. Disponible Properties
- **Buttons shown**: 
  - "Reserve" (btn-primary) - Creates new quotation
  - "View Details" (btn-secondary) - Opens property form view
- **Buttons removed**: Cancel button (as requested)

#### 2. Prereserved Properties  
- **Buttons shown**:
  - "Cancel Reservation" (btn-warning) - Cancels the reservation
  - "Confirm Reservation" (btn-success) - Opens related quotation
- **Buttons NOT shown**: 
  - "View Details" (restricted to disponible only)
  - Cancel button (removed as requested)

#### 3. Sold Properties
- **Buttons shown**:
  - "Fiche Reservation" (btn-info) - Opens invoice/sale order document
- **Buttons NOT shown**: 
  - "View Details" (restricted to disponible only)
  - Cancel button (removed as requested)

### Key Changes Made

1. ✅ **Removed Cancel Button**: No generic cancel button appears in any state
2. ✅ **State-Specific Buttons**: Each state shows only relevant action buttons
3. ✅ **Restricted View Details**: Only disponible properties can access "View Details"
4. ✅ **Proper Button Styling**: Using Bootstrap classes (primary, warning, success, info, secondary)
